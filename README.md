## Intro_to_LaTeX

This is a basic to intermediate level tutorial of LaTeX for those who intend to use LaTeX for academic writing. The participants are supposed to have very 
little understanding of LaTeX. Although LaTeX is a vast *programming language* and it is not possible to cover it in a 2 hours tutorial but this exercise 
should serve as a teaser so that the participants find it easier to deal with LaTeX. After practicing this tutorial, you will be able to write your thesis or reports 
in LaTeX. Once familiar with working with LaTeX, one can modify any template for writing research papers. 


The tutorial covers following topics:

- Basic (and essential commands)
- sections
- Using Packages
- Math
- Figures
- Table
- Hyperlinks
- Bibliography/ citations
- Tracking changes/comments
- Environments
- Creating custom packages (basics)
- Generating plots from data 



In addition to this, I will also try to accommodate the suggestions you have made in survey.
